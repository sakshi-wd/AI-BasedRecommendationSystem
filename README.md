***AI-Based Recommendation System***
## Task Objective:
Build a recommendation system using Java and libraries like Apache Mahout to suggest products or content based on user preferences.

## 💻 What I Built
A User-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommender using Mahout's Taste API.

Input: A data.csv file containing user-item-rating triples.

Output: Top-N item recommendations for a specific user.

Implemented similarity calculation using Euclidean Distance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Java 8

Apache Mahout 0.9 (Taste API)

Maven

SLF4J (Logging)

Eclipse/IntelliJ

## 📁 Dataset
The system reads a CSV dataset (data.csv) from the resources directory in the format:
-userID,itemID,rating

Sample:
1,103,2.0

2,101,5.0

3,104,4.0

 ## Project Structure
src/main/java: Source code

src/main/resources/data.csv: Sample dataset

pom.xml: Maven dependencies and build setup

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
Understood how AI-based recommendation engines work using collaborative filtering

Worked with the Mahout Taste API for real-world recommendation use cases

Gained hands-on experience in Java data processing, similarity computation, and generating predictions

Improved confidence in building AI-powered backend components

✅ Conclusion
In this task, I successfully developed a User-Based AI Recommendation System using Java and Apache Mahout (Taste API). By implementing collaborative filtering and similarity metrics, I was able to generate relevant item recommendations based on user preferences. This project helped me gain practical experience in building intelligent systems and deepened my understanding of how real-world recommendation engines work behind platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify. Overall, this task strengthened both my Java development and data-driven AI logic skills, aligning perfectly with the internship's learning goals.
